# Swarm-computing
Implementation of a distance-constrained group collaborative tracking method, including examples of the error ellipse-based particle filter method and the unscented Kalman filter method.

 ## Repository 
 This repository primarily provides the paper and related code for the research on spatiotemporal-constrained particle filter-based collaborative tracking algorithms for groups. It also includes our data on near-ground wireless signal measurements, as well as a dataset of wireless signal CSI matrices measured with WiFi devices under different driver action modes.
